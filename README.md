# Face Detector 

An **AI-powered** web application that performs **real-time facial recognition** and **expression analysis** directly in your browser.  
Built with **React**, leveraging the **face-api.js** library (a TensorFlow.js wrapper) to access advanced **computer vision** and **facial landmark detection models**.

This project uses **pre-trained deep learning models** for:
- **Face detection**
- **Facial landmark mapping**
- **Emotion classification**

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integration**: Harnesses machine learning models for accurate face and emotion recognition.
- **Facial Recognition Technology**: Detects and identifies key facial landmarks (eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, jawline).
- **Expression Analysis**: Classifies emotions such as *happy, sad, surprised, angry, neutral,* and more.
- **Multiple Face Support**: Processes multiple faces in a single image upload.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All computations are handled in the browser ‚Äî no backend required.
- **API-Driven Architecture**: Loads models dynamically from the **face-api.js** CDN, enabling modular upgrades.
- **Responsive Rendering**: Adapts to image size while maintaining detection accuracy.
- **Secure by Design**: No images are stored or sent to external servers.
